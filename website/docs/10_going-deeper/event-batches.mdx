# Storing events in batches

:::warning
This feature is only available for the Azure provider.
:::

Booster will store events in batches by default, but this behavior can be disabled with some configuration. The
`azureConfiguration` property of the `BoosterConfig` object contains properties for enabling/disabling batch storage of
events, setting the size of chunks of each batch, as well as some other options that are applied when events are stored
in batches.

```typescript
Booster.configure('azure', (config: BoosterConfig): void => {
  // enable/disable event batching (default true)
  config.azureConfiguration.enableEventBatching = false
  config.azureConfiguration.cosmos = {
    // Maximum number of operations in a single batch (default 100, max 100)
    batchSize: 50,
      requestOptions: {
      // Override consistency level for specific operations
      consistencyLevel: 'Strong',
      // Enable/disable RU/minute usage when RU/second is exhausted
      disableRUPerMinuteUsage: false,
      // Specify indexing directives
      indexingDirective: 'Include',
    },
  }

  // Rest of the configuration
})
```
